# HIDEME 
hideme question from picoCTF 23
https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/350?category=4&page=2 <-- this is the link to the question.
Since the description said that the image was sent back forth between two people so there must be some info hidden within the image.So i used binwalk and it extracted a folder in the image.The extracted folder had another folder called "secret" and that has an image called "flag.png".Just open the image and u will get the flag.
The flag is picoCTF{Hiddinng_An_imag3_withn_@n_ima9e_d55982e8}
