#So Meta
https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/19?category=4&page=2 <-- link to the question.
Since in the question the hint given was about metadata which is basically the details associated with the details of the image like sixe and resolution i used exiftool to get all the information of the image and that gave me the flag
The flag was picoCTF{s0_m3ta_fec06741}.
